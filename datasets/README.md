# ML model Name: [e.g. Facial Expression Recognition, Crowd behaviour detection, etc. ]

## Member: [Your Name]

## Dataset Used
- **Name**: <!---Enter the name of your dataset-->
- **Source**: <!---Link to the dataset source-->
- **Size**: <!---[e.g., 35,000 images / 1.2GB]-->
- **Classes/Labels**: <!--- [e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.]-->
- **Format**: <!---[e.g., image folder, CSV labels, video files]-->

## Data exploration results

<!---Look up youtube videos or ask chatgpt how to do the following steps. Document whatever you find about your dataset HERE-->

<!---Load and inspect your data. This can be done programmatically, and include the code snippet used to load your data here if possible. -->

<!---Check for missing data, or anything that may be wrong with your dataset. If it is a video dataset, make note of the frame rates and resolution. Make note of any label inconsistencies, or any other findings after you explore your dataset.-->

<!---If your dataset is perfect, then thats great! Just remember to note down the number of classes(such as happy, sad, stressed, etc.) in your dataset and define them, other useful information in this section.-->

## Preprocessing Plan
<!---If you resize your images, change color formats, perform data augmentation or anything that changes your current dataset so that its in a suitable format to use in an ML model, put it here.

(Also, try saving the preprocessed "Clean Data" in a seperate folder in your computer once you are satisfied with the results.) 
-->

## Model Strategy
<!---
Do a little research on the AIML model algortithm you will be using for your part. Include the research done here, answer questions like "why did you choose this model?" here.

Also include the modifications that needs to be done to the dataset for the given model being used, if any.

Give all technical details on the model you will be using here.
